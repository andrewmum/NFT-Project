 This is a readme for our NFT Project that will be the place holder name until we decide on a real name
 
 
 Since I have kind of started working on this I am deciding we will be using the MERN stack (for now)


Need npm, node, react, express installed atleast to begin


Step one git clone this project onto your local device


Step two cd into project & run npm install to download dependencies


npm start to get the front-end going 


node server.js to get the express backend (boiler plate rn)

Please if you work on this add to the readme any additional steps involved in setting up


whether i left soomething out or there is good information that could help someone else get up and running


File structure not sure of right now feel free to fix it up or change if you feel comfortable
